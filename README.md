# PBL Paneles

## File designation

A part will be designed as follows:
      
      NNN_NN

Where:

      the first number design the module within the whole project

      the second number desgin the subset within the module

      the third number desgin the product within the subset

      the two numbers after low bar enumerates the part within the product
  
## About parametrization

Every part will be parametrized independently and then all parameters will be set and linked in a single CATPart called 'PARAMETROS' which is a product that contains parameter parts named as their product
